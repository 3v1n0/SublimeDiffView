Welcome to DiffView, a VCS diff viewer for Sublime Text 3.

Thanks for installing!  A couple of hints to get you started:
- The default key to run a diff is `Alt + Shift + D`.  Run this from any Git or SVN managed file that has local modifications to start using DiffView.
- From the diff view, press `Enter` to jump to the selected change.  `Alt + D` will drop you back into the same diff where you left off.
- To cancel a diff, press `Escape` - this will take you back to the last point you were editing.


*** Features ***

A quick run-down of the key features:
- Git and SVN support
- Flexible diff options
- Two different diff view modes (see https://github.com/CJTozer/SublimeDiffView#view-style)

All feedback is gratefully received.
