# Contributing

Thanks for helping - we appreciate contributions from everyone.

If you have a specific issue that you're attacking:
* Raise it if it doesn't exist
* Comment that you're working on the fix - this means you'll get help when people see you take on an issue, and prevents duplicating work

When submitting a pull request, ideally:
* Make sure the [unit tests](/tests/README.md) pass
* Try to follow [PEP-8 style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (and/or be consistent with the existing code!)

Finally, pull requests should generally be to the `develop` branch unless there's a very good reason - this project follows [this vaguely standard branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
