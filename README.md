# SublimeDiffView
Diff Viewer for Sublime Text 3

## TODO
* Look at [PythonGit](https://gitpython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference.html#module-git.diff) to get hunk-by-hunk diffs.  Initially wanted to avoid the dependency, but actually it looks like it just makes sense.
* Side-by-side view (with old on the left, removals highlighted; new on the right, additions highlighted)
* Quick view panel (?) that can jump hunk-by-hunk through the diff, for a quick skim through all the changes
