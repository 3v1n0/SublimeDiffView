Welcome to DiffView, a Git and SVN diff viewer for Sublime Text 3.

Thanks for installing!  A couple of hints to get you started:
- The default key to run a diff is `Alt + Shift + D`.  Run this command from any Git or SVN managed file that has local modifications to start using DiffView.
- When viewing the diff, press `Enter` to jump to the selected change.  `Alt + D` will drop you back into the diff at the change where you left off.
- To cancel a diff, press `Escape` - this will take you back to the last point you were editing before DiffView was started.


*** Features ***

A quick run-down of the key features:

- Flexible diff options (see https://github.com/CJTozer/SublimeDiffView#supported-diff-options)
